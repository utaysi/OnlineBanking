# Transaction Ordering Fix Results

## Implementation Summary

The issue with transaction ordering has been fixed by modifying the Virtual_Timestamp calculation in the `data_processing.py` file.

### Change Made:
```python
# Original code:
data['Virtual_Timestamp'] = data['Transaction_Order'] / data['Transactions_Per_Day']

# Modified code:
data['Virtual_Timestamp'] = 1 - (data['Transaction_Order'] / data['Transactions_Per_Day'])
```

This simple change inverts the timestamp calculation, causing transactions within the same day to be ordered from oldest to newest instead of newest to oldest.

## Verification

The script has been run and the results have been verified:

1. The sample data output confirms that transactions are now correctly ordered:
   ```
   Virtual_Timestamp Virtual_Booking_Date
              1.00  2025-03-28 00:00:00
              1.00  2025-03-27 00:00:00
              0.75  2025-03-26 18:00:00
              0.50  2025-03-26 12:00:00
              0.25  2025-03-26 06:00:00
   ```

2. For example, transactions on 2025-03-26 now progress from 06:00:00 (earliest) to 18:00:00 (latest), showing the correct chronological order.

3. All monthly graphs have been regenerated with the corrected transaction ordering.

## Visual Confirmation

The monthly graphs located in `private/images/monthly_graphs/` now display transactions in chronological order (oldest to newest) within each day, providing a more intuitive and accurate visualization of account activity.

## Technical Impact

This change affects only the visual representation of transactions within a day and does not impact any financial calculations or data integrity. The balance calculations and overall trends remain accurate and unchanged.
